1. When doing eigenval analysis with Gromacs, choose "0" (system) for least squares fit.
But choose "3" (C-alpha) for the covariance analysis.

To get the eigenvalue spectrum:
gmx covar -s first.pdb -f fit_1_rt.pdb

Go with "-fit rot+trans" file since that best reproduces the eigenvalue spectrum that your code gets.
That is also what it precisely asks in the assignment.



2.To project along an eigenvector and see the motion:

gmx anaeig -s first.pdb -f fit_1_rt.pdb -filt pc1.pdb -first 1 -last 1

Again choose "0" (for least squares fit) and "3" for eigenvectors (should be same values as in first step).
