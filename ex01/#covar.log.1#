Program: covar
Working directory: /home/dbanerjee/github/usl-laio/ex01

Read 1000 frames from fit_1_rt.pdb (time 0 to 0 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from first.pdb

Analysis group is 'C-alpha' (10 atoms)
Fit group is 'System' (166 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is mass weighted
Diagonalized the 30x30 covariance matrix
Trace of the covariance matrix before diagonalizing: 0.242476
Trace of the covariance matrix after diagonalizing: 0.242476

Wrote 30 eigenvalues to eigenval.xvg
Wrote average structure to average.pdb and eigenvec.trr
Wrote eigenvectors 1 to 30 to eigenvec.trr
